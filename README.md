"OUTSMART" is an android application designed to serve as a common platform for all university study materials.
It includes sections such as Faculty notes, Textbooks(digital library), Presentations, Video Lectures, Online assignment submission portal, etc. 
The idea of "outsmart" came out because of the online study material which was distributed by emails, managing all the notes was a complete mess.
This problem of management was easily solved by this application.
